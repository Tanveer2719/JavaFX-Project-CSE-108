This is a basic JavaFx project which has implemented the java networking feature.  

## Update the Path to javaFX library
Inorder to run the project in VS code, update the path to the javaFX library in the 
`launch.json` and `tasks.json` files in .vscode.

In my case the library is in '/opt/javafx-sdk/lib'. So, I have updated accordingly.
